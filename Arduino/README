How To Build On OS X, Linux and Windows in the Arduino
IDE (at least version 1.6.3).

OS X/Linux
 o Install the latest version of the Golgi SDK somewhere (on OS X it will
   go under ~/Golgi-Pkg)

 o In the developer portal at devs.golgi.io, create a new application, call
   it GolDuino

 o In your IDE sketchbook location, create a directory called GolDuino

    $ mkdir <path-to-sketchbook-location>/GolDuino

 o Copy everything from this directory to that directory

    $ cp <path-to-this-directory>/* <path-to-sketchbook-location>/GolDuino

 o Change directory to the newly created directory

    $ cd <path-to-sketchbook-location>/GolDuino

 o Generate the needed files by invoking the tool to create them:

    $ <path-to-golgi-pkg>/LATEST/Arduino/golgen.sh <developer-key-from-portal> <application-key-from-portal> <path-to-root-GolDuino-directory-from-GitHub>/GolDuino.thrift GolgiGen

 o Decide which transport you want to use (Ethernet/WiFi/Serial/SMS) and
   import the appropriate library into the IDE by going to Sketch/Include Library/Add .ZIP Library

 o Navigate to the Golgi-Pkg install directory, select LATEST/Arduino and
   pick the appropriate library for your transport.

 o Edit the GolgiNet.cpp file and set the appropriate #define to 1 (for
   Ethernet, WiFi, Serial or SMS). If you are using WiFi or SMS, make sure
   you define the extra params needed. See the source for details.

 o Build the sketch and install it.
