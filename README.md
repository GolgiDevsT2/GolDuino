# GolDuino
GolDuino is an example application that demonstrates Golgi being used to
interact with an Arduino board. It is written with an Arduino Due in mind 
with either an Ethernet or a Wifi shield in place as well as three I/O
components:

* An LED connected to Pin 8
* A push button connected to Pin 2
* A variable potentiometer connected to Analog input 0

The Arduino code is built and maintained using the [Arduino Plugin for
Eclipse](http://www.baeyens.it/eclipse). The version of the Arduino IDE
used to build and test this is 1.5.8 BETA. (We are aware that 1.6.0 is
available but this happened late in our initial development cycle).
